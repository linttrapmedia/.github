# The Lint Trap UI
The Lint Trap UI project solves the disparity and complexity we all experience building web applications by introducing three libraries that are: 1. easy to understand 2. have zero-dependencies 3. complimentary.

### [oem](https://oem.js.org)
#### Tier 1: Client-side Rendered Reactive HTML
OEM is a lightweight dom library that allows you to create your own templating engine/s. It's simple to write, easy to test and it follows the Locality-Of-Behavior principle which just makes everything easier to manange.

### [domx](https://domx.js.org)
#### Tier 2: Server-side Rendered Reactive HTML
DOMX is a library for manipulating the dom without javascript using a simple state machine served by the backend. Think htmx, but waaaay simpler.

### [capui](https://linttrapmedia.github.io/capui)
#### Tier 3: Cut & Paste Vanilla HTML, JS & CSS Components
CAP UI is just bunch of cut & paste components made up of most css and a little vanilla js here and there. Modern CSS is powerful and most components need little more than some good css and if needed, a touch of js.
